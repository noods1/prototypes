## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/72f36c5b-abca-4560-baf9-ed565d9d2aee) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## How can I deploy this project?

Simply open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/72f36c5b-abca-4560-baf9-ed565d9d2aee) and click on Share -> Publish.

## Shared Catalog Storage

By default, catalogs are stored in the browser's localStorage (browser-specific). To enable shared catalog storage across all users:

1. **Set up a backend API** (see `api-example/` directory for an example)
2. **Set the environment variable** `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your API endpoint
3. **Deploy your backend** alongside your frontend

The app will automatically use the API if `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set, otherwise it falls back to localStorage.

For more details, see `api-example/README.md`.
